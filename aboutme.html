            <p>My interest in the coding aspect of technology began with the realization there were
            similarities between the structure in code and symbolic logic.  As a graduate in philosophy, 
            that thoroughly enjoyed logic based courses, this intruiged me.  Coupled with the desire to 
            have the freedom to work remotely I felt studying code was an opportunity I had to jump on.</p> 
            <p>As far as what direction I plan to take this professionally, I don't quite have an idea as this 
            is all very fresh to me.  However I can narrow down possibilities based on interests I have.  
            Regarding things more blatantly connected to tech, I enjoy video games and software implementations 
            of board games.  Ending up in that field, writing code to bring these things to life, would in my 
            opinion be the pinnacle of where I could potentially end up.  Furthermore as a regular hiker, kayaker, 
            and soon to be skiier, something related to the outdoors could be interesting as well.  Additionally, 
            though not initially an interest of mine, I could see web page development potentially not 
            only being an avenue, but fascinating.</p>
