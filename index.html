                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a graduate of a two year program in computer science, and I finished with a 
                    background in object oriented programming, control structures, MVC architecture, procedural programming, and an emphasis on how to write clean and efficient code. My interest in the coding aspect of computer science came with the realization there were similarities between the structure in code and symbolic logic.  As a graduate in philosophy that thoroughly enjoyed logic based courses this seemed like an exciting career choice to make, especially given the necessity for computer science going forwards.  Here, on a webpage designed by me, you'll find projects I have worked on or am currently developing. I hope you find them interesting!</p>
            <!-- <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>While I don't feel like I have any singular hobbie I invest more time into than others, theres some worth mentioning.  Maybe the most relevant to coding, I've been playing video games for about 25 years now with some breaks here and there.  The one constant has been an obsession with the Monster Hunter franchise, dating all the way back to a release date purchase of the original 20 years ago.  Other games I enjoy are: Cities Skylines, Civilization, Vampire Survivors, the Horizon franchise, God of War, the Dragon Quest games, and No Mans Sky.  I also thoroughly enjoy games whether that be in the form of board games or playing in a softball league.  Asymmetrical games, Magic the Gathering, and space themed games are some of my favorites.  This also catapulted me into a more recent interest, painting and building miniatures and terrain for certain games.  The relaxation this brings is unparalleled.  Other hobbies include: camping/hiking, going to shows/concerts, working out at the gym, and to some degree cooking/baking.</p> -->
            <!-- <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Ultimately I want to be doing the things I enjoy doing, while setting myself up for a comfortable future.  I would love to end up in a career where I am financially progressing, and get back to travelling like I used to.  A career with the capability to work remotely while travelling, or the time and financial freedom to take time off is a priority going forwards.  Beyond that I want to own a home and finally settle into a place where I don't have to be concerned about where I will live in the long term, and apply skills I've gained in landscaping and handywork to make it my own.</p> -->

                    <p>This is a video presentation of my capstone project with time stamps.  It's a unity based game that randomly generates a map, bakes a navmesh onto the map, 
                        then towers that shoot enemies are placed to route them by breaking the navmesh where they are placed. </p>
