                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a graduate of a two year program in computer science, and I finished with a 
                    background in object oriented programming, control structures, MVC architecture, procedural programming, and an emphasis on how to write clean and efficient code. My interest in the coding aspect of computer science came with the realization there were similarities between the structure in code and symbolic logic.  As a graduate in philosophy that thoroughly enjoyed logic based courses this seemed like an exciting career choice to make, especially given the necessity for computer science going forwards.  Here, on a webpage designed by me, you'll find projects I have worked on or am currently developing. I hope you find them interesting!</p>

It's designed to filter through board games by various means such as difficulty, player count, price, and so on.  It also allows the user to add additional games, publishers, and genres to the database.</p>
