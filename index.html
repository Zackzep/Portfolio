    <p>With my interest in video games I'd like to do some sort of project related to that, 
        whether it be professionally or as a side project.  As someone who saturates their games
        in mods off of the steam workshop I feel like that would be a good place to start.  
        Something that potentially adds unique resource spawns to a game like CIV 6, a new species in Stellaris, 
        or something along those lines.  I'm not sure if this will be the direction I go, but it would 
        make for a fun project.
